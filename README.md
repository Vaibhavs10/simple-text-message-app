# Simple Message Notification App
___
It is a very simple yet useful implementation of the [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)

Twilio helps you in building apps that communicate with the world via voice, video and messaging.

In this implementation of Twilio all you need to do is sign up with twilio and get AccountID, Authorization Token and Twilio number (All which you'll get upon sign up)

## Use cases:

1. You can hook it with any of your script which may take time, for me it was my Machine Learning models which used to take a lot of time to process so I put a text message function at the last, it notifies me as soon as the processing is done.

2. You can use it to set daily reminders or just to message yourself an interesting quote, what not.

3. Pretty much anything that you want yourself to be notified of.

Have fun
